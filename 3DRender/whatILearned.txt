-a good refresher on how classes work with each other

-ArrayList, I have only used int[], String[] traditional arrays in java.
	a ArrayList have a non-fixed size (can added or subtract)
	ONLY STORES OBJECTS
	
-making vertex and triangle static allowed me to call them inside
	main due to there not being an instance of Demo3D in main

(Matrix3D class)	
-Understanding matrix multipication in software was a bit confusing at first.
	I understood the nested loop of rows X colms it was the third loop that confused me.
	I understand now that it's taking two different matrices, the first matrix is where the
	rows and colms come from, the second one is where we are pulling the information to multiply
	by.
