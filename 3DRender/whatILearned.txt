-a good refresher on how classes work with each other

-ArrayList, I have only used int[], String[] traditional arrays in java.
	a ArrayList have a non-fixed size (can added or subtract)
	ONLY STORES OBJECTS
	
-making vertex and triangle static allowed me to call them inside
	main due to there not being an instance of Demo3D in main
